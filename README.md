# Swear Jar ðŸ’°

A simple Chrome extension that helps you put your money where your mouth isâ€”literally. Every time you let a swear slip, add to your balance and decide where it should go.

## How It Works

Simply open the app and hit the buttonâ€”that's it.

Swear Jar runs on the honor system. No AI listening in, no automatic chargesâ€”just you holding yourself accountable.

### What to Do with Your Balance?

Once you've racked up some fines, it's up to you how to spend them:

- **Donate it** to a charity and turn bad habits into good deeds.
- **Reward yourself**â€”because progress deserves a treat.
- **Save it** for something meaningful down the line.
